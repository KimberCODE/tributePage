            <h2 id="headline">Ways Mrs. Rachel helps parents with introducing speak to toddlers:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>FOCUS on the articulation of speech sounds–Ms. Rachel’s mouth is front and center with the video camera likely inches away from her face.</li>
                <li>FOCUS on teaching sign language for basic concepts such as ‘mama’, ‘dada’, ‘eat’, ‘all done’, and ‘more’.</li>
                <li>FOCUS on repetition of vocabulary, concepts, sign language, movement, and fingerplays. </li>
                <li>FOCUS on clapping phonemes and syllables which provides essential practice of phonological awareness .</li>
                <li>FOCUS on social-emotional learning. Ms. Rachel is very consistent in terms of her upbeat delivery, consistency, positive cueing and body language.</li>
                <li>FOCUS on providing parents and caregivers with good speech and oral language modeling. </li>
                <li>FOCUS  on language learning one bite at a time. Even though a typical video can run for 40-60 minutes, Ms. Rachel is careful to present songs and concepts in short segments  without fanfare or visual overstimulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Wearing her signature bluejean overalls, pink T-shirt and a matching headband, she became that friendly woman from the videos: the one who joyfully pronounces words, babbles if necessary, waves and sings to instruct her little viewers.
